This theme component allows you to add two "Showcased" topic lists (built from your choice of two different categories and/or tags) to the top of your forum's home page.

In the theme component settings, you can customize the name of each column, as well as choose which category and tags to pull from, along with the maximum amount of topics you'd like to display.
